## Process and Methods

### **HTML Structure**
1. **Header Section**:  
   Contains the website logo, navigation links, and a prominent headline introducing the site.
   
2. **Information Section**:  
   Showcases notable landmarks in Hyderabad, including Charminar, Buddha Statue, Hitech City, and Ramoji Film City, with descriptive text and images.

3. **Motivational Quote Section**:  
   Features a quote from Chester Bennington, providing a reflective pause for visitors.

4. **Call-to-Action Section**:  
   Encourages users to sign up for a travel package, with a dedicated button for interaction.

5. **Footer Section**:  
   Displays copyright information with proper alignment and styling.

### **CSS Styling**
- **Typography and Colors**:  
  Utilizes a modern sans-serif font stack and a color palette focusing on dark blues, light grays, and vibrant accents for buttons and hover effects.
  
- **Responsive Design**:  
  Uses flexbox layouts to ensure proper alignment and spacing across different sections.

- **Interactive Elements**:  
  Buttons and images include hover effects for an engaging user experience.

### **Images**
- Ensure the following images are available in the `/images` directory:
  - `hyderabad1.jpeg`: Charminar
  - `hyderabad2.jpeg`: Buddha Statue
  - `hyderabad3.jpeg`: Hitech City
  - `hyderabad4.jpeg`: Ramoji Film City

## Known Bugs and Limitations

- **Placeholder Image for Header Content**:  
  The header image currently uses a placeholder. Replace this with a suitable image for better visual appeal.
  
- **Static Dimensions**:  
  The layout may not scale optimally on very small or very large screens. Additional media queries could enhance responsiveness.

## Key Assumptions

- The project will be viewed in a modern browser with support for CSS3 and HTML5.
- The required images are available in the `/images` folder and are correctly named as specified.
